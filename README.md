# Warm Up: Predict Blood Donations

## Goal of the Competition
Our dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.

## What's in this Repository
This repository contains code volunteered from leading competitors in the [Warm Up: Predict Blood Donations](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations/) on DrivenData.
